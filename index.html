    <h3>Agnes Purzycka Graphic Designer and Journalist</h3>
    <p>
       My real name is Agnieszka but I just use the English version of it because it's easier this way. I was born in Poland but I grew up in Italy. I am a graphic designer with a background in journalism. I worked as a journalist for many years but I was always attracted to the visual part of my work. My love for design drove me to finish Design Communication Arts at UCLAx. I work on a pretty old Macbook Pro which I was about to replace before the world as we knew it ended...
    </p>I didn't have to many challenges with getting my local and hosting environment up and running. I got lost just one time when I needed to SSH into my server from my Terminal. I couldn't understand where should I get the data I needed to write after SSH from... In the video Michael pastes the info in and I couldn't understand where did he get the link from... Finally I listened what he was saying and got it! For the rest everything was pretty straight forward... Even though I am not sure if I got everything right with the GIT panel... Lets hope I did everything right!    <ul>
